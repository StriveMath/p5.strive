Welcome! 👋👋🏿👋🏽👋🏻👋🏾👋🏼

p5.strive is an addon library for [p5.js](https://p5js.org) that turns the "software sketchbook" into an environment for teaching and learning mathematics. It adds a right-handed coordinate system, plotting, and a collection of virtual manipulatives -- all with a Python runtime.

The familiar

```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400)
}

function draw() {
    background(220)
}
```

becomes

```python
from p5 import *

def setup():
    createCanvas(400, 400)

def draw():
    background(220)
```

p5.strive wouldn't exist without the incredible work from the teams behind the following projects.

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
- [math.js](https://mathjs.org/)
- [Skulpt](https://skulpt.org/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
